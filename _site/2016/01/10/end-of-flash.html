  </header>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In December 2015, Adobe announced that they would be discontinuing the Flash name with the January 2016 release of Creative Cloud, making way for a new name in interactive development and animation, introducing “Adobe Animate”.</p>

<p>While the new software will still be capable of producing swfs, we expect the new tool to be a more feature rich version of the current Adobe Edge Animate product, a product with firm roots in web standards and html5 outputs.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-e-learning-development">What does this mean for e-learning development?</h2>

<p>E-Learning and Flash have always been best buddies, while web developers quietly relegated Flash to the nostalgia section of the internet, e-learning developers clung on to the feature rich, timeline based production environment, in part because of a lack of alternative options. Particularly with major rapid development tools slow to catch on to the changing standards, Flash development within e-learning was the norm for much longer than in other parts of the web.</p>

<p>Cross platform development, tracking user activity across multiple devices and personalization are the emerging requirements for the discerning e-learning developer. Increasingly the concept of “take this course, sit this test, did you forget yet?” is becoming irrelevant as technology capable of supporting performance and delivering information is carried in almost every pocket, handbag or briefcase. The way users expect to interact with training is changing and the only way to support this change, is to adapt our technical development methodologies and our approaches to training design.</p>

<p>We are entering the age of job aides, just in time learning, micro-learning and personalized content, delivered as often via a mobile device as a desktop screen.</p>

<p>The retirement of Flash provides an impetus for training developers to refresh our design and development practices to better understand and ultimately meet the needs of our consumers.</p>
