# ELabs

With the high number of Ericsson employees requiring OSS/BSS and other training, and the limited number of technical instructors, it was necessary to investigate a means to satisfy the demand. And so, the concept of self-paced eLabs was developed.

Many classroom-based courses feature instructor lectures followed by extensive hands-on exercises, where students gain valuable experience in using  Ericsson solutions. There are, however, significant costs and logistics associated with classroom-based training Ã± travel, accommodation, printing and shipping materials and so on. With self-paced elabs, students benefit from instructor lectures and hands-on practice without any travel requirements. 

## The Process 

The ELab experience starts with the student registering for a self-paced eLab via ITM. An Administrator sends the student joining instructions, links to any pre-requisite training, and pdfs of the materials. Next, a virtual machine is created for the student. The student can then start the self-paced eLab any time during a specified time window. 
 
The classroom-based lectures have been adapted for web-based learning and available via ITM.

Each lecture is accompanied by recorded demonstration of the exercise to be performed by the each student and then, following instructions in a student exercise document, the student performs the same exercise on their own instance of a virtual machine. In case of difficulty, an instructor will be available via chat or email to answer questions, and share screens with students to rectify any problems.

Being self-paced, students can take as long as they wish doing the exercises, they can watch and replay the videos at any time. To assess the students competence, instructors will provide feedback on the completed exercises.

We hope this short overview has helped you appreciate the value and benefits of self-paced eLabs.
