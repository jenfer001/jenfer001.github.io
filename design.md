#High End Design

We work with experts in the field to ensure we create accurate content that is highly relevant to the audience. Our standards are high, our processes are proven and our output is rigorously tested, this means that we create quality products every time.

##Our Process

Every project is slightly different, but we do have standard procedures that smooth the learning experience design process, enabling collaboration between subject matter experts, instructional designers, graphic artists and technical developers.

Once training needs have been analysed we are able to create solutions to fill each need. Working with experts, we populate storyboards and create wireframe models. This allows us to test our product at each stage of development, we like to involve the end user as early as possible to ensure the design meets their needs. 

Development begins once the designs are finalised and tested, we often design templates, which can be re-used, this means our delivery times are short, but the output quality remains high.

###Example: Video Series

This example is where we have taken a storyboard in PowerPoint, uplifted the graphics and added narration and animation to create high-quality content. Each of these modules can be launch on an LMS inside a HTML wrapper â€“ we have productized this process.
