## Got an app for that?

In 2016 Ericsson ITM students will see the launch of the SuccessFactors app – the mobile version of ITM - and with it a whole new way to access lots of great eLearning content…oh wait that’s not actually true…let’s rewind a little! 

Whilst ITM offers hundreds (and maybe thousands of courses if you include the Skillsoft library) there aren’t many internally developed courses that will be available when the app is launched.  This is because it is actually quite difficult to take your traditional desktop courses (flash-based, fixed-size, bandwidth-hungry) and make them also play perfectly on a tablets or smartphone.

Apart from the obvious issues with the Adobe Flash plugin not playing very nicely with mobile devices, the main issue with traditional eLearning courses is they were never designed for mobile and so they often don’t display properly on a mobile screen.  Nowadays mobile designers are looking to utilize a responsive layout which adapts and often dynamically changes layout depending on the device being used.  

### But creating content for mobile is difficult right?  

Well actually it’s probably easier than you thought.  If you have a template to begin with you only need to be able to produce the content that fits into that template.  For example we have a simple HTML5 wrapper (template) that provides responsive video which can be loaded to ITM, all you need to provide the single video for that wrapper.  We also have a complete mobile responsive UI that is controlled entirely via XML where you literally plug in your video links and assessment questions to create a whole course – it doesn’t come easier than that right?  Here’s an example of this UI in action – you can try this in your browser or on a mobile device.

### So how do I create education content for mobile?  

We’ll probably cover other mobile content types in a later blog so unless you are adept at building HTML5 interactions then the quickest content-to-mobile process is going to be video.  The most popular video type that is compatible with most computers, mobile phones and tablets is the MPEG-4 container format (.mp4 video files).  

There are many applications that will create MP4 videos, there are also some that will convert existing video (such as FLV) to MP4 too and lots of these applications are free.  As a team we can guide you in the video production process, including instructional design and storyboards to create an engaging video, the recording/conversion tools to use for the job, the compression rates and codecs you need for efficient video deployment and all the templates and integration requirements required to deploy your videos (and video courses) to ITM.

[Here’s a brief video tutorial](https://play.ericsson.net/media/t/1_l2uzqykv) on one of those simple processes for creating MP4 video from a standard PPT presentation.
