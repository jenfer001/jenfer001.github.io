In eLearning, content is king! Whether your eLearning content is scripted for narration or on-screen text, content is at its best when it is well-structured with concise, honed messaging for the target audience. Here are some guiding principles for developing successful eLearning course content.

## 1.	Consider the Information Architecture
If you are tasked with developing content for a Sales Overview or Technical Overview course you will be provided with a course content template. This template has been developed following a needs analysis of what our sales people need to know. Follow the content guidelines within the notes section of each slide, as this will ensure the following:

- A logical flow of concise information for our target audience
- Avoidance of repeated content

If you are not following a course template, spend time considering how you can logically structure your messaging for your target audience. 

Good information architecture also contributes to a great user experience for our learner. For example, if our learner wants to know about ‘Business Benefits’, they can open the course and navigate directly to that asset title to view exactly the information they are looking for. 


## 2.	Hone Your Messaging
Hone your messaging and make it concise. The learner will not be able to retain all of the information provided within a single sitting of the course. Focus on the core messages you want to communicate. In eLearning less is more! 


## 3.	Avoid Communication Conflicts
A common problem found in eLearning is communication conflict. This occurs when the onscreen text/graphics show one thing, but the narration discusses something different. This simple conflict of information creates cognitive overload for our learner, as their mind grapples to understand both sets of information! As a rule of thumb for eLearning, the visual graphics or text should always follow the narration. 

## 4.	Put Key Messaging in Course Test Questions
When developing course test questions, you should aim to provide a broad set that draws upon the key messaging from the course. It is useful to think of the course test as an opportunity to reiterate and help embed key information from the course. Here are some examples:

Revenue Manager is a convergent, end-to-end charging and billing system designed using architectural principles that embrace the new business models of the Networked Society.

- True

Select the following architectural pillars on which Revenue Manager is built:

- Real-time

- Scalable
- All of the above

Within an operator, Ericsson sales people should approach the following people to discuss RM: (Select Three)

## Summary
Developing eLearning content based upon these principles takes time to get right. But these efforts will add up to form a valuable eLearning course that features well-structured and concise messaging for your target audience.
