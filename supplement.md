# Supplementary Content

For some of our courses, we have developed downloadable books and info-graphics to support the course content. This enables users to keep learning beyond the confines of the course. They may take this content offline, use it as reference or to support the understanding of users with English as an additional language.

## Our Process

We use the information collected for the course content and re-purpose it for delivery in a readable form. Sometimes this involves creating diagrams or infographics to support the content. We are also able to produce eBooks for a variety of devices.
