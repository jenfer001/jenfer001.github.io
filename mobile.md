# Mobile 

We know that mobile data traffic is growing quickly year on year, users expect content to be delivered across a variety of devices and with a number of new features.
In response to the change in consumer needs we have developed a HTML5 based, mobile ready user interface, this means that we can quickly deploy a variety of content to any device, with consistent standards and behaviors. In addition to this, the interface has been successfully tested on the Success Factors mobile app, due to be launched in 2016.

## Why do we need an interface?

An interface acts as a wrapper for e-learning content. The content could be quiz questions, video snippets, or something more interactive, like a scenario exercise or simulation. The interface allows the user to easily navigate between learning activities. Common elements to find in a user interface are:
- Navigation menu, allowing users to access labelled pages.
- Progress indicators, ensuring users know which content has been accessed and how much is left to view.
- Social media integration, giving users the opportunity to share or rate the content

## Our interface provides:

- Thorough usability testing to ensure a seamless experience
- ITM integration and user tracking
- Delivering content across any device
